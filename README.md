# PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Websites by Larry Ullman
## My work through the book

I started with PHP for the Web by Larry Ullman and now I'm working through the
second book in the series.

All code outside of modifications I've made from problems suggested in Pursue Exercises is

Link to the book to buy on Amazon: [PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Websites, 4th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Dynamic-Web-Sites/dp/0321784073/)

This is the second PHP book I've ever done.

I decided to get on to Git while I learned so I can get used to working with version control early.
